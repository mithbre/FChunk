Remove hashing of null byte (da39a3ee5e6b4b0d3255bfef95601890afd80709)
-for files that are multiples of -c
-caused by hashOutLength = (srcLength / BUFFERLEN + 1) * HASHLEN;
Fix oversized ghash file
-Run -c 1, with a reasonably large file. There'll be several 0x00 at the end.
-on second thought, it's not oversized. Something is failing.
Arguments
-Load hash files (-h)
-make patch (-m)
-Patch file (-p)



High level overview
-----------------------------
Step 1:
Read a in 15MB chunks.
Hash each chunk and store the hash.

Step 2:
Do the same thing to another file that is supposed to be the same.
Store the numbers of differing chunks.

Step 3:
Copy the corresponding chunks from the original file to a new file.

Step 4:
Copy those known good chunks into the bad file.
Recheck.
