High level overview
-----------------------------
Step 1:
Read a in 15MB chunks.
Hash each chunk and store the hash.

Step 2:
Do the same thing to another file that is supposed to be the same.
Store the numbers of differing chunks.

Step 3:
Copy the corresponding chunks from the original file to a new file.

Step 4:
Copy those known good chunks into the bad file.
Recheck.
